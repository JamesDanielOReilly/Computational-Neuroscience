In both languages the function returns a spike trains for the interval
[0,big_t] with overall firing rate rate and refractory period
tau_ref. The rate exp_rate calculated in the function is the rate the
Poisson process must have to give the correct overall firing rate
given the refractory period. 	  

I often find it useful to define SI units at the start even if they
are just "1.0" this makes it easier to keep track of units and stops my 
making embarassing mistakes divinding by 1000 in my head.
